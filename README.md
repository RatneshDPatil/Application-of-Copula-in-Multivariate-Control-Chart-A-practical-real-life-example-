# Application-of-Copula-in-Multivariate-Control-Chart-A-practical-real-life-example-
In this study, we demonstrate how copulas are useful for modeling dependencies in multivariate data. By integrating copulas, multivariate control charts become more flexible and robust, enhancing their ability to monitor complex processes.
This repository delves into the innovative application of copulas in constructing multivariate control charts, presenting a practical and advanced approach to monitoring and enhancing quality in complex processes. Copulas serve as a powerful framework for modeling dependencies between variables, even when their distributions deviate from normality.

By leveraging copulas, this study demonstrates how multivariate control charts achieve unprecedented flexibility and accuracy, making them exceptionally effective at detecting subtle and critical changes in process behavior.
